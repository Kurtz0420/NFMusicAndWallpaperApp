[Intro:]
A few words to define my music?
I'd say it's pretty laid back

[Hook:]
Let me see those hands up! [x4]
Hands up!

[Verse 1:]
Yeah I'm like Ali when I write hooks, get it? Right hooks
These songs are like the chapters of my life and this is my book
Yo you seein' me on these stages, go into a song I'm turnin' these pages
Turn the pages, welcome to chapter 1 of my life: "Crazy!"
Yeah, let's call it that if ya'll don't mind, I got a dope mind
With these Pope lines, I don't smoke I'm in a cold clim-ate
So ya'll better hold on
They telling me that I'm loco, um, tell me something I don't know
Ain't that a clear picture, no photo, yeah clear pictures, no photo
And yo this ain't about the photos or the fame life
I kill my flesh and live for God all in the same life
So call me what you wanna, but I'm a do what I gotta, yup
And anybody got a problem, shh, NF real music

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
Yo I started from the bottom no Drake though, yeah I came in the game like, "Hello!"
I came in the game like, "Let's go!" This beat might break your neck your bones
But that's okay, okay, you ain't heard of me, then you so late
So just take a seat of that cold plate, and just let- let- let-let me explain
Yo, "NF" be that logo, "Capitol" be that label
If I see beats on my table, I swear, I'm a eat the whole plateful
And that's my life, I write what I mean so I might, go a little bit cray when I find mics
I ain't doing it so I am in the limelight, cause that limelight, it ain't life
Am I in this for the money? Hey quit crackin' jokes
Cause we all know this industry is known for cuttin' throats
And if this was all for money I'd have quit years ago
But it's not, so turn me up until my ears explode, let's go

[Hook]

[Bridge:]
Let me see those hands up [x4]
Hands up
Oh
Let me see those hands up
(Where you at? Where you at?)
Let me see those hands up
(Where you at? Where you at?)
Let me see those hands up
(Where you at? Where you at?)
Let me see those hands up
(Where you at? Where you at?)
Hands up
(W- w- w- w- where you at?)

[Hook x2]
