Hey yo girls show 'em that song I taught you
I got Jesus what you got
I got Jesus what you got
I got Jesus what you got
Either you're saved or you're not hear me

Yea yea yea
Woo woo
Y'all know what this is
I got a question for y'all man
(I'mma give it to you)
It's who you living for
(I'mma give it to you)
I know who I am
Eah eah eah eah
Let's go

Yea I got Jesus what you got
I got Jesus what you got
I got Jesus what you got
Either you're saved or you're not
[x2]

Yo my god He's so powerful
That he forgiven though my shame it will devour you
Overpower you and demolish you
Have you wrapped up runnin' like a coward do
Yo it's crazy look around
I was always told the devils under the ground but is he under it now I don't really feel that way
He around it's around in the world today
I got Jesus and I'm not scared
If you got a problem he's right there
He's right here this ain't no lie
Forget about the world I'm with God in the sky
You don't need money
You don't need fame
All you Gotta do is rap his name you rap that chain
It ain't gonna save you dude
Forget the world don't listen to what they sayin' to you

I got Jesus what you got
I got Jesus what you got
I got Jesus what you got
Either you're saved or you're not
[x2]

Try to refuse me somethin' I would try to do you watch TV
Yea they gonna lie to you
Have your mind mixed up in a bad position
Like hey everybody let's laugh at Christians (come on)
Like that don't make sense to me
Why should I have to repent for things
Why would a God that loves me so
Leave me in world so broke so cold
People askin' the wrong questions
Someone gave you the wrong message
Or why would a God that's fake come down
To this earth and get socked in the face
Died for his faith did nothin' wrong
Thorns in this head
Nails in his palms you don't care
Why would I lie to you
He don't love you then why would he die for you

I got Jesus what you got
I got Jesus what you got
I got Jesus what you got
Either you're saved or you're not
[x2]

Jesus came down to this earth to die for our sins
Sent his only begotten son to save us
The least we can do is praise him

Gotta give it to God man
Check it out I'mma show you how real is yeah

God made land God made trees
God made you God made me
My God took a little bit of dirt made man
Imagine where your life could go in his hands
You don't understand
Picture this
Thorns in his head
Nails in his wrists
Stretched like this
Dying for us yea
Extraordinary in God I trust
He died for me I died for him
He died perfect lord I've sinned
Take me in
Set me free
Without you I'm not me
We're not worthy of your grace
But you show it Lord so thanks
Satan mad 'caus we believe it
He don't like it when we scream it

I got Jesus what you got
I got Jesus what you got
I got Jesus what you got
Either you're saved or you're not
[x4]

So many people walk around in their own little world
Living for things that won't satisfy
And you won't feel satisfied until you find the one true God
If you don't look for the truth
How are you supposed to find it
I got him what you got

Yea it's the truth y'all
You don't look for the truth
You not gonna find the truth most of us
Without Jesus you're nothin' then what you got
