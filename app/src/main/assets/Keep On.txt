[Hook - Jeremiah Carlson:]
Oh, these hands are tired
Oh, this heart is tired
Oh, this soul is tired
But I'll keep on
I'll keep on [2x]
I'll keep on [3x]

[Verse 1 - NF:]
Faith is something I am not accustomed to
Trusting other people 's something I don't really love to do
I've never been a fan of it, I act tougher
Really my shoulders they ain't built for this and I don't have nothing
It's like I'm standing in the rain and you offer me a raincoat
But I would rather stand there wringing wet than take the handout
What's wrong with me? You said, you've always got your hands out
And I cannot continue on my own so take my hands now
I give you everything, God, not just a little bit
Take it from me, I am nothing but a hypocrite
I hate sin but I built a house and I still live in it
Afraid to open up the door to you 'n let you into it
My soul is lost and what it needs is your direction
I know, I've told you I do not need your protection
But I lied to you, this thing is tiring
A man was not created for it
God, please retire me now

[Hook - Jeremiah Carlson]

[Verse 2 - NF:]
Trust is something I am not accustomed to
And I know the Bible says that I should always trust in you
But, I don't ever read that book enough
And when I have a question I don't take the time to look it up
Or pick it up
It collects dust on my nightstand
I'm just being honest
Please take this outta my hands
I have no control - I am just a person
But thank the Lord that I serve a God that's perfect
I do not deserve the opportunity you've given me
I never knew what freedom was until I learned what prison means
I am not ashamed, I don't care if they remember me
My life will always have a hole if you are not the center piece
Take me out of bondage, take all of my pride
If I don't have a Savior, I don't have nothing inside
Take all of my lust, take all of my lies
There's no better feeling than when I look in the sky, in your eyes
It's amazing

[Hook - Jeremiah Carlson]

[Outro:]
Whoa
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa
Whoa whoa whoa
I'll keep on
I'll keep on
I'll keep on [3x]

I'll keep on [3x]
