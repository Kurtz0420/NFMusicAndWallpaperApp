Baby, I guess I don't understand
How did we let this slip through our hands
We were so in love and then we...
Lost it all, and now it's over...
Now it's over...

I know we said that we could just be friends
But I can no longer play pretend
Because the memories of us cloud my head
And I'm sorry...
So sorry...

But, I have to say goodbye (Yeah)
Goodbye...
I don't wanna say it (Nah)
I don't wanna say it
I don't wanna say goodbye
Goodbye...
But we have to...
But we have to...

And baby I guess I can't comprehend
The fact that this could really be the end
I wish we could talk this out instead
But we've tried that...
Haven't we tried that?

I am doing my best to let this go
Cause, it's obvious that we're on different roads
You consume my mind when I'm alone
I miss you
Oh, how I miss you

But, I have to say goodbye (Yeah)
Goodbye...
I don't wanna say it (Nah)
I don't wanna say it
I don't wanna say goodbye
Goodbye...
But we have to...
But we have to...
