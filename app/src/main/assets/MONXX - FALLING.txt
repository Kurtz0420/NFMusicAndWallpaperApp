I'm sorry, but I don't want to be an emperor.
That's not my business.
I don't want to rule or conquer anyone.
I should like to help everyone if possible
Jew, Gentile, black man, white.
We all want to help one another
Human beings are like that.
In this world there is room for everyone,
and the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone
The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way
Falling, fading down, down, down...
Falling, fading down, down, down...
Falling, fading down, down, down...
Falling, fading down, down, down...
Falling, fading down, down, down...
Goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed,
but we have shut ourselves in.
Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want.
Our knowledge has made us cynical; our cleverness, hard and unkind.
We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery,
we need humanity. More than cleverness,
we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities,
life will be violent and all will be lost, lost, lost, lost, lost...
