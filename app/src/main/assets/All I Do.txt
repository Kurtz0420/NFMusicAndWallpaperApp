This is all I do, this is all I do
This is all I do, this is all I do

I just put a hundred in the bank
I don't mean a hundred thousand, haha, yeah, yo, I mean a hundred dollars
They say that I got no humor in music, then why am I smiling?
Why am I smiling, you do not feel it? Why are you lying?
You know somebody that’s iller than me? I wanna meet 'em
I wanna meet 'em, enough with the talking, woo, I wanna see 'em
I do not look at these rappers out here like I wanna be 'em
I look at these rappers out here like I wanna beat 'em
I am competitive, always been that way
Always been that way, that’ll never change
Fans hit me up on my Instagram like you've been singing too much
Then the moment I stop you gon' write me and say I ain’t singing enough

I feel like LeBron
I feel like LeBron, I feel like LeBron
They don't know, they don't know
This is all I do, this is all I do, this is all I do

This is all I do, this is all I do
This is all I do, this is all I do
This is all I do, this is all I do
This is all I do, this is all I do

I have been at this for years, this didn't fall on my lap
I get so personal with you, you feel like you know me, you feel like we met
Fans getting into the music, relating, tell me what's doper than that
How you say your the best in the game when you sound like you don't even know how to rap?
I used to hand out my demos at shows like listen to me
This ain't what it seems, I never sleep which is funny cause I'm out here living the dream
You say you're living the dream, no you just living a dream
Y'all need to wake up and get out of your bed and quit sleeping on me
I got my head in the game, you know what that means?
(You know what that means?)
They got no clue, they got no clue
I thought I already told you before this is all I do

I feel like LeBron
I feel like LeBron, I feel like LeBron
You don't know about now, you don't know about now
This is all I do, this is all I do

This is all I do, this is all I do
This is all I do, this is all I do
This is all I do, this is all I do
This is all I do, this is all I do

What you know about that
What you know about that? Nothing
What you know about that
What you know about that? Nothing
What I know about that
What I know about that? Something
What I know about that? Something
I feel like LeBron
