[Verse 1:]
You in that tough place
You in that life prison
You at that rough stage
But pretend your life isn't
I know a Savior
Who can save you take you out the chains
My God is major can't contain it
Gotta spread the name
Your life has got you low
That don't mean nothing
Let Him run the show
And make you mean something
Wonder why you feeling broken, feeling empty
Cause if you ain't got the Lord you've never been free

[Hook:]
I don't feel the chain no longer
Used to feel so weak
Now I feel stronger
What I got to do to make you see
I been through the struggle and the pain
Now I'm free
Yeah
Now the weight's off my shoulders
Feeling brand new
And I thought I done told ya
He got me out the place I was at yeah
And I promise you
I ain't going back baby

[Verse 2:]
Free
Now you know you trippin' majorly
Your eye gone off the ball
Like you playing in the major league
Making bad calls
Striking out
Livin dangerously
Tryna steal bases face it
Think it's time to change your team
Basically
He can take your life and rearrange it
Say you want freedom but you ain't ready for changes
He can flip your life around
Something like the matrix
Used to feel chained up
Now you feel amazing
Amen uh-huh
You know that feeling like you're brand new
No longer are you living like you can't move
He took you out the bondage and he freed you
Instead of yelling: "Chained up!" now you yelling: "Freedom!"

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
I want you to free me Father
I'm so sick of the pain that bothers me
To the point I scream and
Holla looking for a way to get away better wait to get away no option
Gave me the ball I dropped it
Had your plan in my palms I mocked it
Told you I would give it all but I'm not so you gave me a chance
I blew it, I bombed it
See I know I don't deserve it
I don't wanna be this broken person
Living in the dark no hope incurving
Losing all my heart, hopeless, nervous
Choking, burning, I hate these burdens
They break and torture me
And they forcing me
Into something I know I was never born to be
But now I'm free

[Hook x2]
