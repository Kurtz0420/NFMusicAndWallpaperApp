This thing called love can be so cold
It can be miserable, or it can be beautiful
This thing called love can be so cold
Sometimes it's amazing, sometimes it's crazy
This thing called love

Check, check, eh
Listen, your love is like a drug that everybody uses
You wanna know the outcome
Depends on how you use it
Love could be your best friend
Love could be your enemy
Love could be the thing you wish you had
But you don't ever see
Love can be the reason why You're afraid to have it
Some say it like it means something
Others it's a habit
And some would say it's tragic
Some say it's beautiful
Some say it's black and it's dark Like a funeral
And some would die for it
Some don't think it's even real
Some say they understand
But don't know how it feels
Some say that it's alive
Some say that it can kill
But most of us that been in it
Know that sometimes it will
I ain't gonna sugarcoat it
Yea, sometimes it might surround you
One minute it's saving you
Next it's trying to drown you
Some people want to show it
But were never taught how to
And some of us is searching
Feeling like it never found you

This thing called love can be so cold
It can be miserable, or it can be beautiful
This thing called love can be so cold
Sometimes it's amazing, sometimes it's crazy
This thing called love

Your love is like a privilege
A lot of us abuse it
Do with it what we want
And then start drama when we lose it
Pretend that it ain't nothing to us
Pretend like it's useless
We don't know why we do this
But yet, we still pursue it
And love, it can consume you
Turn you into something else
Bury the real you so deep
That you can't even find yourself
Love, it can change you
Love, it can tear you down
Be the best thing you ever had
And kick you on the ground
Yo, you get on that high level
Yea, you scared to fall
Cause you know if that person hurts you
You gonna lose it all
They told you they would be there for you
They don't even call
So that openness you used to have
Has become a wall
Some say that it's patient
Some say that it's kind
I don't think it's invisible
But I know that it's blind
To some it's only physical
Or all up in their mind
See, it probably isn't there
If you're struggling to find it

This thing called love can be so cold
It can be miserable, or it can be beautiful
This thing called love can be so cold
Sometimes it's amazing, sometimes it's crazy
This thing called love

This love has got me down low
Now I guess I'm up high
One minute I'm on the ground
Next minute I'm in the sky
I feel invincible
And so unrejected
Forget it, I'm invisible
And I feel unprotected
Yo I don't need nobody else
Trust me, I'm fine
I can't do this by myself
I'm losing my mind
I can see clearly
Forget it
I'm blind
My heart says "DANGER"
Can't you read the signs
Yo but through all the pain
I swear I love it
No matter what you do
It don't disappear
Does it
(Yo) I'd rather
Spend a minute with love in my life
Than go a million years without knowing
What it's like
You better grab it
You don't want to lose it
It brings pain
It's insane
But the bruises
My God can take that all away
You'll find that right person
And everything that you thought
That wasn't becomes worth it

This thing called love can be so cold
It can be miserable, or it can be beautiful
This thing called love can be so cold
Sometimes it's amazing, sometimes it's crazy
This thing called love
