Water is all polluted
Beach is all just sewage
And I'm just tryna find my girl
Before it all is ruined (hey)
Water is all polluted
Beach is all just sewage
And I'm just tryna find my love
Before it all is ruined (hey)
Water is all polluted
Beach is all just sewage
And I'm just tryna find my girl
Before it all is ruined (hey)
Water is all polluted
Beach is all just sewage
And I'm just tryna find my love
Before it all is ruined (hey)
Woke up in Venice beach with an itch for some nicotine
Stepped outside and saw the sun and felt the rays against my cheek
Life is sweet, but the end is near so wasting time is suicide
I'm down to ride and I'm always here
Locked up in my own heart, tryna find my own peace
Focus on survival and forget about that ol' feast
I'm all good, no bad days
Crushing out a roach with my two fingers in the ash tray
Unfolding like a lotus, happiness is my motive
Poetry is my modus, used to fear that no one would notice
Now there's thousands that know this, And Russians who can quote it
Woke up and I'm zoning, started writing and owned it (uh)
Water is all polluted
Beach is all just sewage
And I'm just tryna find my girl
Before it all is ruined (hey)
Water is all polluted
Beach is all just sewage
And I'm just tryna find my love
Before it all is ruined (hey)
Water is all polluted
Beach is all just sewage
And I'm just tryna find my girl
Before it all is ruined (hey)
Water is all polluted
Beach is all just sewage
And I'm just tryna find my love
Before it all is ruined (hey)
Say the end is coming, and ain't no point in running
Nowhere safe there's no escape, this karma's gon' be something
Schools keep on closing but the prisons always stay open
Whole system is broken, can of worms has been opened
Might as well keep smoking, cease the day and go and own it
Dig a grave and toss a rose at all of my opponents
Blow a kiss straight to my girl, she's the only one in the world
Share my bed and all my bread, fingers running through her curls
But now I gotta find her, lost her in the summer
All alone and the worlds end and what a fucking bummer, but
Swear to God I'mma find her cause true love waits (ahh)
Been singing all these love songs before it's just too late
