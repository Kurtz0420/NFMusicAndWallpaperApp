[Intro:]
[Britt Nicole:]
It feels like a tear in my heart
Like a part of me missing
And I just can't feel it
I've tried and I've tried
And I've tried
[NF:]
Tears on my face I can't take it
If lonely's a taste, then it's all that I'm tasting
Do you hear my cry?
I cry, oh

[Hook - Britt Nicole and NF:]
Can you hold me? [x2]
Can you hold me in your arms?

[Verse 1 - NF:]
Just wrap me in your arms, in your arms
I don't wanna be nowhere else
Take me from the dark, from the dark
I ain't gonna make it myself
Put your arms around me
Put your arms around me
Let your love surround me
I am lost
I am lost

[Bridge - Britt Nicole and NF:]
If I ain't got you here
If I ain't got you, I ain't got nothing at all

[Hook:]
Can you hold me? [x2]
Can you hold me in your arms?

[Verse 2 - NF (Britt Nicole):]
Yeah, Yeah
Yeah, I feel like it's just me, like it's just me
What it gon' take? What it gon' be?
I don't even know
(It's not just you)
But I'm lonely
Feeling like I don't even know me, I don't even know me
(I feel it too)
Gotta have you gotta see you
(You're the only thing I have to think about
The only one I that can't live without)
I see you
(I need you need you to hold me now)

[Bridge - NF:]
If I ain't got you [x2]
I ain't got nothing [x2]
If I ain't got you
I ain't got you
If I ain't got you
I'm lonely
If I ain't with you I'm lonely
I'm lonely
I need you
I need you

[Hook - Britt Nicole:]
Can you hold me? [x2]
Can you hold me in your arms?

[Outro - NF:]
Feel like it's just me, like it's just me
What it gon' take? What it gon' be?
I don't even know, I don't even know
But I'm lonely, lonely
Feel like I don't even know me
Feels like I don't even know me
I don't even know me
