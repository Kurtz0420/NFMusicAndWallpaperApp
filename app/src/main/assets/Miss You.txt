Oh I miss you
Whoa I miss you
Now your gone yeah
Now your gone
[x2]
No

I should have been there told you that I loved ya
Held a little tighter as I kiss, and I hug ya
I should have called ya, told you that I missed ya
Tears on my face as I'm looking at your pictures
Yeah I'm with ya, but only in this mindset
Since you've been gone you ain't left my mind yet
And I'm upset, but not because of you
I wish all I remember was the good, I never do
I guess when you lose things, thats when you appreciate it
If you were hear, then I'd show you my appreciation
But your not, so I'mma have to learn to cope with it
Got a box of memories, but I'm scared to open it
I see you smiling, but only when I'm dreaming
I know your gone forever, but somehow I don't believe it
Somebody wake me up, my eyes closing
I'm hoping some day you'll be there when they open, but

[Hook:]
I never thought I'd have to say goodbye to you so soon
But now your gone
Now your gone
I never thought I'd have to say goodbye but now I do
And I miss you
Oh I miss you

Yeah, I wish you can hear me
But I know you don't
And I wish you would call me
I know that you won't
But why I gotta cry second dwelling on the negative?
Use what you love, It will take you where you never been
Yo depression, naw far from it
Have I cried? Oh yeah I've done it
If I could I'd change, and I'd go back
Problem is if we could, yeah, we'd all do that
I can see you laughing at my memories
Sad part is that's the only thing I'll ever see
You use to wear a tough face and play pretend
Now, the fact is I'm never going to see you again
See my life just doesn't seem right without ya
I can feel the tears coming when I think about ya
Matter fact I think I feel some now
I'm sick of holding them back
That's why I'm letting them out

[Hook:]
I never thought I'd have to say goodbye to you so soon
But now your gone
Now your gone
I never thought I'd have to say goodbye but now I do
And I miss you
Oh I miss you

I look in the mirror I can see you in my face
I could care less now about your mistakes
Not cause they don't bother me not cause they ain't bruise me
I just trying to feel like you ain't never knew me
I'm all mixed up lost in the emotion
Loved you so much, too bad I never showed it
But on the upside, there's one thing
You put a smile on my face most times I sing so
Mom if you were here today, I would put my arms around you
And tell you I love you
I'd tell you I love you
Yeah, I would put your hand in mine, and tell you everything's okay
Oh I miss you
Oh I miss you

[Hook:]
I never thought I'd have to say goodbye to you so soon
But now your gone
Now your gone
I never thought I'd have to say goodbye but now I do
And I miss you
Oh I miss you
